If it is left untreated, the skin may become more sensitive and severely infected, which can later cause long-term problems such as infection in the blood, unwanted dark spots, wrinkles, and fine lines. It is also important for the doctor to find out what type of triggers cause these conditions so that a customized treatment can be suggested. Regular appointments are typically needed every 5-6 months. Therefore, a skin specialist can look after the skin's health and help one avoid skin issues that might occur later in life.
