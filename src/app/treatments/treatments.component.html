                            makeup or the use of cosmetic products as more beauty influencers are
                            choosing a bare skin look. So, more and more people are now taking
                            interest in having a clear, smooth, and youthful complexion that they can
                            proudly flaunt. Although topical skincare can keep the skin hydrated and
                            healthy, more intense procedures are required to treat common skin
                            imperfections like acne, pigmentation, aging concerns, and many more.

                            (i.e. activated charcoal). Once applied, the carbon mask is evenly distributed
                            by massaging the treatment area. The carbon nanoparticles possess the ability
                            to seep deep into the skin and absorb all the skin impurities as well as excess
                            sebum and dead skin cells from the clogged skin pores.
                        </p>
                        <p>Next, the laser technician under the supervision of a skin expert in Noida at
                            Skinlogics passes the laser light in short pulses with a skin contact time of one
                            billionth of a second from a Q-switched laser over the treatment area. The
                            laser energy is highly attracted to the carbon particles to cause their explosion,
                            damage the inner pore walls, and take away all the absorbed substances along
                            with it. When the laser is targeted, the patient may feel a warm, tingling
                            sensation but there’s no discomfort as such during this treatment. The
                            Q-switched Nd: YAG laser works at a set of two different parameters (i.e. at
                            two different wavelengths) which is initially at low energy then at high energy.
                            In this treatment, only this type of laser is used as it does not cause damage
                            to the nearby healthy skin by the generated heat.

                            in the skin. It causes selective photothermolysis of the melanin pigments which
                            gets eventually cleared from the body by natural removal processes that take place
                            in the human body.

                        <p>Simultaneously, the laser light also reaches the deeper skin layers (i.e. the skin
                            dermis) to stimulate the synthesis of new collagen and encourage healthy-looking,
                            youthful skin. As the growth of collagen and elastin fibers is promoted, skin
                            regeneration takes place. The heat generated from the lasers can even kill the
                            acne-causing bacteria and shrink the sebaceous glands to reduce sebum production,
                            both of which are responsible for plugging of skin pores. As a result, the skin
                            structure is visibly strengthened and the enlarged pores are cleared and purified.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The entire procedure may last for about 20-45 minutes but the longevity depends
                            upon the area of concern. A course of anywhere between 2-6 sittings at a gap of
                            4-6 weeks may be needed to achieve optimal results followed by touch-up sessions.
                            The number of settings varies according to the patient's conditions and expected
                            outcome. Thankfully, in each laser session, the eyes are covered with special
                            goggles to protect them from the effects of laser light.</p>
